# A-star-Pathfinder
A* Path Visualizer provides an interactive visualization of the A* pathfinding algorithm, allowing users to create barriers, start and end nodes, and observe the algorithm's process of finding the shortest path.

## Features
- Interactive grid where you can place a start node, end node, and barriers
- Visualization of the A* algorithm's progress in finding the shortest path
- Manhattan distance heuristic for estimating the distance between nodes

## Requirements
- Python 3
- Pygame Library

## Controls
- Left-click: Place barriers (black) or set start (orange) and end nodes (turqoise)
- Right-click: Remove barriers or reset start and end nodes
- Spacebar: Start the A* algorithm, shortest path will be shown as a trail in purple
- 'c': Clear the grid and reset start and end nodes
