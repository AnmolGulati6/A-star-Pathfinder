# A-star-Pathfinder
A* Path Visualizer provides an interactive visualization of the A* pathfinding algorithm, allowing users to create barriers, start and end nodes, and observe the algorithm's process of finding the shortest path.

## Features
- Interactive grid-based interface
- Create barriers to block the path
- Set a start node and an end node
- Visualize the A* algorithm in action
- Observe the shortest path from start to end
- Reset the grid and start a new search

## Requirements
- Python 3
- Pygame Library

## Usage
- Clone this repository or download the source code as a ZIP file.
- Navigate to the project directory.
- Run the main script: python astar.py
- Interact with the program by following the instructions
- first click on grid will be start node, second click will be end node, any node after will create barriers
- Press the spacebar to start the A* algorithm
- Purple path highlights the shortest ppath by A* star algorithm
- Press 'c' to clear the grid and start a new search.
- Close the program window to exit
